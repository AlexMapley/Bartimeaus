Overview:
Bartimeaus is an open-source general purpose AI, aimed to be flexible enough to be trained for any task.
It is designed to learn from the web, crawling through websites and parsing html documents to build a 
language and information memory bank.


Current Goals:
- Optimize LanguageCollector.py to be able to crawl/parse html docs more efficiently
- Better refine data generated by LanguageCollector.py for later mining









Components:
- LanguageCollector.py: Allows Bartimaeus to crawl through the web and parse raw html info, extracting text
between <p> tags.
