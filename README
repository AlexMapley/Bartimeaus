Overview:
Bartimeaus is a Penetration Testing Framework, with the ultiamte goal of making an assistant Ai to help in system exploits.


Current Goals:
- Optimize spider.py to crawl through the web, more quickly
- Better refine data generated by Spider.py for Archiving, mainly by string parsing individual paragraph elements 
- Develop command line interface for Bartimaeus in general, marking each specific function as it's own "-" flag









Components:
- spider.py: Allows Bartimaeus to crawl through the web and parse raw html info, extracting text
between <p> tags. Specifically, spider.py limits its search scope to the contents of one single website,
and attempts to archive ever single component of its web directory
